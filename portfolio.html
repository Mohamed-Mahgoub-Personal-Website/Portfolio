                        I've crafted a user-friendly website that allows individuals to submit their wills securely, ensuring their loved ones can access them when needed. Using my full-stack development skills, I designed an intuitive interface with a unique DEMO on the login page that showcases the site's features without requiring login details. The platform includes will submission, encrypted document storage, and easy retrieval, all while maintaining security standards

                        I've crafted a stylish website for a makeup artist and hairstylist, offering a streamlined experience for clients. Visitors can discover services, check out current offers, schedule appointments, and leave reviews after receiving services. The site's user-friendly design makes it easy to explore and engage with the artist's offerings
