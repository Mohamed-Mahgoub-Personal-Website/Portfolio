            <p>
                I started my journey way back in high school when I decided to become a doctor.
                I know, it doesn't make sense "what?! a doctor? what are you doing as a developer?".
                Well, long story short I worked as a phlebotomist as I was completing the prerequisites and I decided while observing the doctors role that it wasn't for me.
                I switched my career path to Networking and Cybersecurity and got my bachelor's degree in it with a 4.0 GPA.  I started working at Amazon and was introduced to software development.
                I started learning about it and until this day I keep loving it more and more.

                I love nature and being outdoors.  I found that I love coding just the same.
                Learning is one of my strengths because I am able to navigate and find what I am trying to learn on my own.
                Working with a team is a great way to get work done.  I work on a team at my current job and I can't put into words how greatful I am for team work.
